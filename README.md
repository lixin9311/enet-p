Reproduce [EnhanceNet: Single Image Super-Resolution Through Automated Texture Synthesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8237743/) by Sajjadi et al.

Given an low-resolution image, the network is trained to produce a 4x resolution image using different loss functions.

### Usage
1. Dependencies: Keras, Tensorflow, Scipy, Pillow, matplotlib

3. mkdir datasets images

4. Modifiy the dataset name, image shape, and the training parameters.

5. Put the dataset in the datasets folder, with a acorrding subdir name.

6. Run it, and watch the images folder.
